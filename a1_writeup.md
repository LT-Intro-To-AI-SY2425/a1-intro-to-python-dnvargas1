# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?
I thought that it was a bit different from the programming languages I have done previously, having a much higher emphasis on indentation and also not having many parenthesis included as well. After using it for a short bit, I can tell that it is similar to Javascript and definitely easier than Java.


2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?
It is very similar to Javascript in that it doesn't have to define the variable when declaring it, instead letting Python do the work instead and figuring out what data type a variable is the moment it is declared. It is very different to Java, with java having to call the class, create an object, and define the data type before being able to declare a variable.


3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?
I definitely improved upon my basic understanding of Python and how to use it, being able to work with loops, arrays, and assert statements much more easily than before. I also learned how to use AI effectively to solve my problems, using generative AI like ChatGPT to help explain problems that were previously providing me lots of difficulty.
